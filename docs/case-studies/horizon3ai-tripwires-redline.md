!!! note "About This Writing Sample"
    This is *not* official Horizon3.ai documentation.

    I created this editorial redline as part of a Horizon3.ai job application exercise.  
    The assignment was to review an existing documentation page (NodeZero Tripwires) and provide clear, actionable edits that improve clarity, structure, and consistencyâ€”without rewriting from scratch.

## My Editorial Approach

I evaluated the Tripwires documentation at both the **macro level** (overall structure, flow, and navigation) and the **micro level** (style, consistency, and tone).  
Some of the key areas I addressed:

- **Structure & Navigation**: Break long lists into tabs/accordions, add troubleshooting anchors, and introduce flowcharts  
- **Consistency**: Standardize admonitions, hyperlink style, and UI element formatting  
- **Voice & Style**: Shift to active voice, resolve sentence fragments, and align terminology with branding  
- **Audience**: Reduce jargon, make prerequisites explicit, and emphasize actionable instructions  

This exercise demonstrates my ability to:

- Critically evaluate existing documentation  
- Apply consistent editorial standards  
- Enhance usability while preserving technical accuracy
