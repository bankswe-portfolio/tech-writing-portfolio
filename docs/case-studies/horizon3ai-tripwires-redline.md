# NodeZero Tripwires Redline Case Study

!!! info "About this case study"
    This is *not* official Horizon3.ai documentation.  
    
    This exercise shows my approach to improving an existing documentation page.  
    Rather than rewriting from scratch, I created an editorial redline in Google Docs to highlight opportunities to enhance clarity, structure, and consistency.

## My Editorial Approach

I reviewed the NodeZero Tripwires documentation for both **macro-level structure** and **micro-level style** issues.  
Some of the key areas I addressed:

- **Structure & Navigation**: Break long lists into tabs/accordions, add troubleshooting anchors, and flowcharts.  
- **Consistency**: Standardize admonitions, hyperlink style, and UI element formatting.  
- **Voice & Style**: Shift to active voice, rewrite fragments, and align terminology with branding.  
- **Audience**: Reduce jargon, make prerequisites explicit, and emphasize actionable instructions.  

This exercise demonstrates my ability to:

- Evaluate documentation critically.  
- Apply consistent editorial standards.  
- Improve usability while respecting technical accuracy.
