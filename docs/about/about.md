# About the Portfolio

This portfolio serves two purposes: it showcases my writing samples and demonstrates the workflow I use to build and ship documentation.  

The site runs on **MkDocs** with the **Material for MkDocs** theme and is deployed through **GitHub Pages**. 
All content is written in Markdown, tracked in Git, and published automatically. 
Updates follow the same pipeline used on a product team: commits, pull requests, reviews, and continuous deployment.
