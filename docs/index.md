# Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome — thanks for visiting.

This portfolio collects case studies that demonstrate my approach to technical writing.  
Each piece was created either as part of a job application exercise or as an independent project to showcase how I handle developer-facing documentation.  

Across the **Case Studies**, you’ll see how I:

- Translate complex tools into clear, scenario-driven guidance  
- Balance technical depth with accessibility for different audiences  
- Treat documentation as part of the product experience, not an afterthought  

The goal is to show both *how* I write and *why* I make the choices I do — clarity, usability, and context always at the center.


## About Me

I’m Will Banks, a technical writer and former research engineer with 10+ years of experience translating complex systems into clear, actionable content.  
My background spans developer SDKs, APIs, avionics standards, and biomedical platforms — all unified by one theme: making technical knowledge approachable and useful.

I specialize in **docs-as-code workflows** (AsciiDoc, Markdown, MkDocs, CI/CD pipelines), **developer-focused documentation** (SDK guides, API references, conceptual explainers), and **technical storytelling** that connects product features to real-world outcomes.

Before pivoting full-time into documentation, I worked on projects ranging from U.S. Navy defense systems to FACE-conformant avionics platforms and Unity-based neuroscience tools.  
Along the way, I’ve authored comprehensive developer guides, built automated doc pipelines, presented at technical summits, and contributed to peer-reviewed publications.

What drives me is clarity: giving engineers, developers, and product teams the confidence to adopt and extend complex technology.

## Skills & Tools

- **Tech Writing:** CLI & repo workflows, docs-as-code (AsciiDoc, Markdown, PlantUML, Graphviz, OpenAPI, Postman, static site generators like MkDocs and docToolchain), AI-driven workflows
- **Programming & Scripting:** Python, C++, Bash, JSON, YAML, Workflow Automation; IDEs including VS Code and IntelliJ IDEA 
- **Agile Tools:** Jira, Confluence, Git, Teams, Zoom  
- **Operating Systems:** Windows & Linux (WSL)  

## Highlights

- Authored the **FACE Technical Starter Kit Developer’s Guide**, distributed across the avionics industry.  
- Built automated pipelines and docs-as-code workflows from scratch.  
- Presented product development and documentation at the **MOSA Summit** and Vanderbilt symposia.  
- Contributed to multiple **peer-reviewed publications** across physics and biomedical research.  

## Case Studies: Documentation in Action

Each case study demonstrates how I tackle a specific documentation challenge — whether creating new material, editing existing content, or balancing conceptual depth with practical guidance.
