# Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome—thanks for stopping by.  
This site highlights case studies that show how I approach technical writing in real-world contexts. Each piece is a self-contained story: a mix of problem, solution, and documentation strategy.

Explore the **Case Studies** section to see how I:

- Break down complex tools into approachable guidance  
- Translate technical depth into clear, actionable docs  
- Treat documentation as a core part of the product experience  

Each case study is written to stand on its own, but together they illustrate my philosophy: documentation isn’t an afterthought—it’s a product in itself.  

If you’re curious about the process, you can view the **source Markdown** on GitHub via the “Edit this page” link above.
