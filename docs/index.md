# Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome. This site shows polished, standalone samples across three doc types:
- **How-to** for task-focused guidance
- **Concept** for explanation and mental models
- **Reference** for precise, scannable details

You can view the **source Markdown** on GitHub via the “Edit this page” link at the top.
