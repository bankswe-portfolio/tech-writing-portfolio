# Technical Writing Portfolio

This repository powers my live portfolio site:  
👉 **[View the site](https://bankswe-portfolio.github.io/tech-writing-portfolio/)**

The focus is on **case studies**—self-contained stories that show how I approach technical writing in practice. Each one highlights a different product, audience, or challenge, and demonstrates how I turn complexity into clarity.

- 🗂 **Case Studies:** real-world scenarios with problem → solution → docs strategy  
- 🧾 **Source:** Markdown under `/docs`, built with a docs-as-code workflow  
- ✍️ **Goal:** show documentation not as an afterthought, but as part of the product itself
